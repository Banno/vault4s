/** Helper methods for working with Vault
  *
  * @note
  *   The implementations here are mostly correct (with the exception of
  *   deprecated methods) however they do not handle token lifecycle or retries
  *   (Vault is eventually consistent, and when inconsistency is detected, they
  *   return `412 Precondition Failed` instead of the stale value).
  *
  * @note
  *   Consider using the more modern [[VaultClient]] for better ergonomics,
  *   lifecycle management, and retries.

  /** <h1>WARNING: This method is deeply flawed.</h1>
    *
    * Don't panic, and please migrate to [[VaultClient]] at your earliest
    * convenience or replace this with [[Vault.readSecret]].
    *
    * <h2>CAUTION: `fs2.Stream` abuse</h2>
    *
    * `fs2.Stream` is entirely the wrong effect type to model what is happening
    * here, because of this there was a long-standing bug where it could
    * immediately revoke the token.
    *
    * There isn't really a fix for this, because the root issue is
    * [[fs2.Stream.concurrently]] doesn't seem to compose with
    * [[fs2.Stream.ToPull.uncons]]. This issue was noticed back in
    * [[https://github.com/typelevel/fs2/issues/3123 February 2023]], and at
    * time of writing is still open.
    *
    * <h3>Mitigation</h3>
    *
    * If possible, migrate to [[VaultClient]]. If this is not possible, try to
    * avoid doing anything fancy to your [[fs2.Stream]] between when this method
    * is called and when it is used.
    *
    * A non-comprehensive list of methods to avoid:
    *
    * <ul>
    *
    * <li>Any variation of [[fs2.Stream.ToPull.uncons]]</li>
    *
    * <li>Any variation of [[fs2.Stream.drop]]</li>
    *
    * <li>Any variation of [[fs2.Stream.take]]</li>
    *
    * <li>Any variation of [[fs2.Stream.hold]]</li>
    *
    * <li>[[fs2.Stream.resource]] and other methods which return a
    * [[cats.effect.Resource]]</li>
    *
    * <li>[[fs2.Stream.drain]]</li>
    *
    * </ul>
    *
    * <h2>CAUTION: Vault secret leases and engine types</h2>
    *
    * While most of the secret related methods in [[Vault]] implicitly assume
    * the KV1 secret engine, this method does not.
    *
    * KV1 secret engine leases do not invalidate the secret when they expire,
    * they're cache hints that suggest how long to wait before checking if the
    * value has changed. There's no functional difference between using this
    * method to read a KV1 secret and simply reading the secret once.'
    *
    * <h3>HOWEVER: non-KV2 secrets <i>may</i> expire</h3>
    *
    * Dynamic secrets (like database credentials) are a common example, so if a
    * secret becomes invalid after a set period of time, this method may be what
    * is needed.
    *
    * <hr/>
    *
    * This function uses the given Vault client, uri, and authenticated token to
    * obtain a secret from Vault. It then also provides a Stream that
    * continuously renews the lease on that secret, when it is about to finish.
    * Upon termination of the Stream (from the using application) revokes the
    * token (but any error on revocation is ignored).
